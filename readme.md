# Hello there!

Welcome to my open source project! Let me explain to you what this is about. ðŸ™Œ

Note: This project is continuously being worked whenever i have time atm.

Recently i've been looking for different projects to work on, and a couple of days ago i found out about Jekyll.
I became fascinated and inspired by the concept, and thought: "Hmm, something like this would be fun to replicate in NodeJS".

The main foucus areas for my projects are always simple and intuitive designs.
When i sat down and started working on this, i challenged myself to come up with a solution that
even the freshest of programmers could understand how to use. I'm not saying that i have completed this,
but i think that the approach i've chosen is at least in the right direction. I've also tried to come up with a
'language' for the post-writing, as this project is aimed for being simplified (but comprehensive enough for most usage).
There not a lot of syntax yet, but i've tried to create the source-code so that adding more syntax is easy.

However, i am still just a junior developer attending college. I really want to begin engaging more into open source
code and communities, and gain knowledge about all the different tools people use when programming together over the web (i am really fresh here, no experience at all).

Therefore i want to seek people that find some excitement in this project, and want to join me on developing it even more.
I would love to collaborate with people that i can learn from, and maybe create a little group where the main goal is to develop our skills while having fun and experimenting with new things. If enough people are interested, then maybe i can create a Slack/Discord group

If you have any questions, or want to join in on this little open-source project, then send me an ðŸ“§ at mathiaswpicker@gmail.com

Have a nice day!
