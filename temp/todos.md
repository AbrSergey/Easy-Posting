# Full TODO/Idea list:

- Create proper documentaion and explanation for usage.
- Enhance the code and improve the structure so that it can easily scale
- Create an 'updateTemplate()' function that updates all the posts with a new template provided.
- Create an 'updateJSON()' function, in case the user accidently removes the file.
- Give user more options; Dark mode for post? Decide how to order JSON?
- Add optional navigation overlay on posts?
- Adding optional "show related post at bottom" feature? And figure out how to create this
- Maybe add support for different HTML templates like Pug, Handlebars etc.? (probably a hairy goal, but could be fun)
- Create env-commands for executing program.
- Learn how to properly create a NPM package.
- Create a cool website for the project.
- Set up test enviroments and other practical stuff.
- Let user choose if `<a> tags should have a 'blank' (or maybe newtab) attribute` instead of automatically set target="\_blank" to all link tags created.
- Make it so that the content of headers shouldn't have to be on the line beneath the trigger? If so, maybe copy the way markdown creates titles (if allowed?)

- Come up with tons of more ideas.
